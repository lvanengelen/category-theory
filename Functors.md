# Functors

Functors map objects and morphisms from a source category to objects and morphisms in a target
category, while maintaining *structure*.  This means that connections between objects are preserved,
as are morphism compositions and identity morphisms.

Just like functions, functors can collapse multiple objects into a single object and multiple
morphisms into single morphisms (`Delta_c` is the extreme example, collapsing everything to a single
object and morphism).

Functors between categories compose (c.f. functions).
