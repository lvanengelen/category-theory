# Products and Coproducts

In category theory, objects and morphisms are opaque: you can only identify a specifc object by
describing its relations to other objects defined by its morphisms.

In `Set`, `Void` is the initial object and `Unit` the terminal object.  In this last case, the
uniqueness of the morphism is important, because there are lots of morphisms from all objects to a
single one (e.g. two from any object to `Bool`).
